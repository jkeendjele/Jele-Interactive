Popyea Remote Work Chat Application

Description: With Covid 19 forcing businesses to adjust to new ways of working we decided to create this user friendly application that allows businesses who have affected by the
             pandemic the opportunity to chat remotely (without their data being tracked ie. whatsapp, slack, microsoft) and delegate different departments in the chat to dicuss different 
             aspects of theior businesses with certain individuals of their team.

The Chat Application was built with the Javascript framework ReactJS. We made use of this framework for the frontend. The backend was built with chatengine.io,
which simplifies the process of building a chatengine in a few steps.

The app is mobile responsive through the chat, however if you want to add more departments and members onto your company you need to use it on desktop.
Since this is the MVP DEMO, we only programmed a few users to currently participate, however its possible to scale and enable more users and organisations.

The application temporarily hosted on netlifyas it provides free and easy hosting (https://popyeachat.netlify.app/)
